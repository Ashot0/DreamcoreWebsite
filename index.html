				<div class="content__text">
					<p>For anarchy, drugs are not the main thing, they are not suitable for politicians either, and can
						be considered an
						anti-revolutionary tool, since they tend to give rise to apathy. I definitely believe that this
						country is going through
						two revolutions: on the one hand, it is a political struggle, and on the other hand, we are
						witnessing a cultural
						renaissance. The use of drugs comes along with the birth of a new culture. After all political
						battles have been won, a
						time will come that will be difficult in every way. This is the time when the entire population
						- black and white, right
						and left - will come together to create a new society. This new society will be described,
						planned and discussed by
						literally everyone. It will be a type of society completely free from repression, of which there
						are so many today. It
						will be based on trust, since every creature has the right to believe. Free use of drugs will be
						characteristic of this
						new culture. No more political arrests for marijuana or acid, who will arrest whom and for what?
						There will be no more
						dark cases in prisons or high-profile trials, because. no more prisons.

					<p>
						Marijuana is the basis of the revolution. It undermines social foundations and helps shape a
						completely new way of
						thinking. The components of the revolution are: marijuana, freedom, liberty. The Bolsheviks of
						the revolution will be
						long-haired marijuana smokers.
					</p>


					<p>
						A quote from the works of Jerry Rubin, who in the 70s was sentenced to more than five years for
						free expression of his
						thoughts.
					</p>
					<p>

						Of course, drugs act on consciousness and allow a person, as for the first time, to see the
						world freely, without the
						usual attitudes and prevailing conventions. For the first time, a person can clearly see real
						inconsistencies and
						imagined absurdities. The drug is an ancient law and the oldest legislator given to us
						illegally. Our job is to use it
						for good.
					</p>
					</p>
					<p>cultivation
					<p>
						Marijuana, marijuana - different names for the same plant - cannabis. In America, you can get
						many different varieties
						of it, such as: Acapulco Gold, Panamanian Red, Vietnamese Green and New York White. All these
						names correspond to the
						strength and place of collection of marijuana. In the US market, marijuana from Mexico and
						Vietnam is considered the
						best. Middle Eastern marijuana is also highly valued, but is not readily available. You can't
						tell which product you're
						buying without first trying it, as most types of cannabis look alike and smell the same, no
						matter how strong the
						exposure. Of all the cannabis varieties, New York white is the most interesting, as it is a
						plant of great narcotic
						power, naturally growing in the populous capital. Cannabis is often found in empty car parks,
						behind alleys and in
						school yards; but, oddly enough, the place where it often grows is the sewer.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Department of
						Health and Sanitation
						tried to explain this phenomenon in a series of printed reports. They found that the practice of
						marijuana smokers to
						throw the seeds down the toilet to avoid arrest led to the development of large underground
						thickets. The main blame for
						the numerous blockages and floods in the sewers falls on these thickets. From the reports, it is
						clear that the sewers
						have created ideal conditions for the growth of marijuana. It is humid and warm there, and the
						refuse lying around in
						abundance serve as good fertilizers. Sewer plants typically reach a height of 12-15 feet and are
						pale in color due to
						lack of sunlight. This is the answer to many questions - for example, why rats walk in the
						middle of Park Avenue.
					</p>


					<p>
						There are many methods of growing cannabis and each seems to offer the highest yield. I cannot
						describe all the methods
						in five books, so I will focus on the two that seem to me the most effective.
					</p>

					<p>
						Method One
						Many seeds are fertile, but those from Mexico are the best. Never, under any circumstances,
						throw away the seeds,
						because marijuana is a weed and will grow anytime, anywhere.
					</p>
					<p>
						Growing
						The first step is to soak the seeds overnight in clean, slightly warm water. Your container can
						be a regular seedling
						box. If this is not possible, take a plastic dish about two inches deep, it will do just fine.
						Fill the container with
						washed fine sand and crushed sphagnum moss. If this is not possible, use ordinary earth. The
						earth should be tightly
						packed, well watered, excess water should be removed. Dig holes half an inch deep along the
						entire length of the box.
						You are now ready to plant the seeds. Make holes every inch. Fill each hole with soil, sand,
						moss and water. Cover the
						box with a clean sheet of plastic wrap and place it in a warm place with at least six hours of
						sunshine a day. Leave the
						seedlings like this until the first sprouts appear. If you do not have the materials described
						above, the same success
						can be achieved by placing the seeds in several layers of damp paper towel. Then cover the seeds
						with a sheet of plastic
						wrap as above and expose them to the sun.
					</p>

					<p>
						After about a week, signs of life will begin to appear. In two weeks, individual small sprouts
						should already grow. Now
						it's time for the transplant. The field where you want to plant seedlings must be carefully
						prepared. Manure should be
						laid at least a week before transplanting. The soil should be similar to the one in the seedling
						box. Everything else,
						especially the area of your plot, should be thought out in such a way as to give your plants
						maximum freedom. The
						container with seedlings the day before transplanting should be watered so abundantly that the
						streams of water wash
						away the weakest plants without damaging the roots. Seedlings should be planted in holes 2 or 3
						inches deep, depending
						on the size of the plants. The soil around the sprouts should be loose, and if you can, add some
						earthworms to the soil.
						If there is not enough light, a simple ring of tin foil will help you, with which you should
						surround the sprout. After
						planting, the first few days are usually the most critical. If the plants survived this shock,
						there is no reason why
						they should not be healthy and tall (15 to 20 feet).
					</p>

					<p>
						Care
						At this stage, little care is required, only fertilizer is needed. As a fertilizer, you can use
						manure, soluble
						nitrogen-containing compounds, sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate or humus, popular at all times.
						To make the plants grow
						stronger, they should cut off the lower leaves, but this should be done only when the shoots
						have reached a height of at
						least three feet. The land around your plants must be cleared of other
					</p>
					</p>
					<p>وقتی دستانت را می‌گیرم،
						به غروبی...
						به پرنده‌ای...
						به سُرودِ سپیدی می‌مانم
						که بر من ماه سفر می‌کند.
						شکلِ ساحل می‌شوم
						بر من خون سفر می‌کند
						ستاره می‌شوم
						بر من شب سفر می‌کند.</p>

					<p>weeds, and insect pests, oddly enough, do not touch marijuana.</p>

					<p>Harvesting</p>
					<p>
						As a rule, shoots should be cut off after they have produced seeds, but if greed rushes you, you
						can kill the goose that
						lays golden eggs for you. The best way to dry is in the sun, but if you live in a city where
						it's not safe to dry 5-10
						foot tall marijuana trees, use a quartz or tanning lamp. If drying takes place in the sun, the
						process takes about two
						weeks. When using a lamp, the grass is ready for smoking in 3-4 days. After drying, separate the
						leaves and crush them.
						This is the best product, of course, if you do not choose to use female marijuana. If so,
						separate the flowers - this is
						just what you need. Stems and branches can be used for smoking through a pipe, they can be sold
						to "friends".
					</p>

					<p>
						Hemp is a weed and can grow anywhere, including indoors with artificial light. Tanning lamps
						give a good effect from a
						distance of 2-3 feet. As an interesting experiment, light half of your plantation with a tanning
						lamp and the other half
						with an infrared lamp, then compare the results. For a city dweller, an ideal plantation can be
						a bathtub or a mixer for
						making cement (well, it can be smaller).
					</p>

					<p>Second method</p>
					<p>
						This method is somewhat more complicated than the first, but brings truly wonderful results.
						First of all, you will need
						a seedling box. It has the following construction: take 1 wooden milk container and cut the
						sides to a height of 6
						inches. Cover the hole with clear plastic, leaving one hole open. Lay a piece of wood across the
						top of the container
						and attach a 60 watt light bulb to it. Now you have a seedling box. You will need "Kitty Litter"
						(you can buy any soil
						mix) and milorganite (you can replace it with manure). Take one part of manure or milorganite
						and mix it with five parts
						of Kitty Litter, fill a box two or three inches full with this mixture, and moisten well. Now
						spread the seeds, twenty
						seeds per thirty square inches, on top of the soil and top them half an inch with the Kitty
						Litter and Mylorganite
						mixture. Run a 60-watt light bulb 24 hours a day. When the seedlings sprout, turn on the lamp
						only as an addition to the
						sunlight.
					</p>

					<p>
						Seedlings should germinate in a box for about a month, and then they should be transplanted. The
						landing site should be
						securely covered, the soil should be well fertilized. When this is done, dig holes about a foot
						deep and as wide as
						needed. Give each plant enough space, do not restrict their freedom. To stimulate and help
						growth, use a variety of
						fertilizers: humus, milorganite, manure - before planting, as described in method one; after
						planting, water your
						plants, add about a glass of slaked lime per square yard of field to the water. It usually takes
						about eight months for
						marijuana to go into effect, but it adapts remarkably well to any growth phase. You will always
						be able to distinguish
						the female, as her plants are smaller. She needs special care. To preserve the crop, the ideal
						method is to hang the
						plants in a well-ventilated barn. Now give the harvest time. If for various reasons you are in a
						hurry, or there is no
						suitable shed, you can dry your crop in an oven at temperatures below 200°C. As in the first
						method, you can use a
						tanning lamp.
					</p>

					<p>
						Distribution of marijuana by varieties
						The flowers of females have the greatest power (these are small shoots and seeds at the very
						top).
					</p>

					<p>
						The small sprouts of the upper leaves of the females are also very strong. They are often coated
						with resin and are
						second grade.
					</p>

					<p>
						The third variety of marijuana is the upper leaves, they are also strong, but not as strong as
						the first two varieties.
					</p>

					<p>The fourth and lowest grade are all males and all the leaves of the upper half of the males.</p>

					<p>Note</p>
					<p>
						If, for one reason or another, you have not decided to grow your own cannabis plantation, you
						will generally have few
						problems in order to get it. When buying marijuana or anything illegal in general, remember the
						basic rules.
					</p>

					<p>
						First and most important: do not buy anything on the street or from strangers. You may not
						believe it, but the police
						pay millions of dollars to keep civilians roaming the streets trying to provoke unsophisticated
						buyers.
					</p>

					<p>
						There is another reason why shopping on the street is a bad habit: you can't try a product
						without buying it. There are
						many chances that when you come home, you will find that you have bought the most wonderful
						parsley or celery that you
						have ever had to smoke.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cooking with marijuana
						Many people, after cleaning the raw materials, throw away the seeds, stems, branches. I strongly
						recommend that you keep
						them, because. there are many recipes for these ponytails and scraps.
					</p>

					<p>
						A hot, delicious tea-like drink can be made very simply by collecting your waste products in a
						muslin ball or piece.
